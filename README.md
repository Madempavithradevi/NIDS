# 🔐 Final Year Project: Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts whether network traffic is **Benign**, **FTP-BruteForce**, or **SSH-BruteForce**. Users enter traffic features into a web form, and the trained machine learning model (`best_nids_model.pkl`) returns the prediction in real-time.
